I have a very limited online presence. You'd be pretty skilled to even find an actual photograph of me. This is a comprehensive list of all of the public profiles that I have online:

* Github - [JohnMertz](https://github.com/JohnMertz)
* LinkedIn - [mertzjohn](https://linkedin.com/in/mertzjohn)
* Mastodon - [@mertz@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@mertz)

You can send me PGP encrypted email using [this GPG key](https://old.john.me.tz/misc/john.me.tz.gpg).

I'm now operating a new project and associated [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/SpamTagger) which also utilizes [spamtagger.org](https://spamtagger.org) as its official domain. That domain and organization are the only authoritative sources for information related to this project. Other online profiles mentioned through official links on those pages may be added over time in order to share news, etc.

I currently own the following domains:

* john.me.tz
* mer.tz
* shb.ng
* spamtagger.org
* byteapp.org

It's possible that I'll fail to keep this updated, but until you confirm via one of the channels above, you should assume that anyone else pretending to be me via any other online profile is an imposter.<br>
