I've recently departed from Alinto, the company which acquired my former employer, MailCleaner. However, I still like the MailCleaner product and the Community version is entirely open source, so I'm currently resuming development and providing freelance support for existing MailCleaner users.

To that end, I have started a new [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/SpamTagger)
 and am working on a significantly updated fork of MailCleaner called [SpamTagger Plus](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger-Plus).

It has also become clear over the last several years that continued development on a project the size of MailCleaner is not particularly feasible for just one person, so once SpamTagger Plus is stable and I have set up more sustainable maintainance procedures, I will seek to then starting to work on a simplified fork simply called [SpamTagger](https://github.com/SpamTagger/SpamTagger).

This is also the first time I've had the opportunity to take more than a week off in about a decade, so I'm also spending time on a bunch of smaller side-projects like this website which should make for a fun little distraction!

Away from the computer I'm an avid maker! I'm working on net-zero retrofits of my 1950's bungalow and working on plenty of smaller projects in the past which I might blog about some day.
