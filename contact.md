Hi! So lovely that you'd like to chat!

If you somehow got here because you are a former MailCleaner customer and you would like to talk, please email me. I have set up an address for **mailcleaner** at the domain **john.me.tz**.

If you want to email me about something else, use **contact** at the same domain.

If you want to connect on social media, I only have accounts on [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@mertz) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mertzjohn). I barely use either, so it is not a reliable way to contact me.
